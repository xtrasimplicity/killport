# killport
Simple bash script to kill a process which uses the specified port.

## Installation
Simply make a directory in which to store the script, i.e. ``/opt/scripts/killport``, clone this repository therein, set the script to executable, and add this path your $PATH environment variable, as follows:
```
mkdir -p /opt/scripts/killport && cd /opt/scripts/killport 
git clone https://github.com/xtrasimplicity/killport.git .
chmod +x killport
echo 'export PATH="$PATH:/opt/scripts/killport"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

## Usage
Simply run killport as follows:

```killport PORT_NUMBER```

i.e. ``killport 3000``

By default, killport sends each process a `SIGTERM` signal, allowing the process to gracefully terminate. 
If you want to *forcefully* terminate the process, you can pass the `-f` option to have killport send a `SIGKILL` signal.

i.e. ``killport -f 3000``
